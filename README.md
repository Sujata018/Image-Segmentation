    <td>The origram identifies the pores (large, circular black regions having reflections from bottom), then draws green border on the polygonal approximation of the pores, and calculates distances between each vertices of different pores (line drawn in yellow), that does not cross any pore. With these distances, it creates a histogram of pore distances.</td>
